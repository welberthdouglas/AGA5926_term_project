## Abstract

<p align="justify">
Several factors contribute to noise in astronomical images. Random noise from the sky background, the telescope detector and optical system play a part to build noise in images that can make it difficult to identify and study structures. [Schawinski et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/467/1/L110/2931732) showed the potential of GANs for noise reduction and recovery of galaxy features for images artificially degraded. In this project we will use SRGANs to increase image quality (pixel density and signal to noise ratio) of S-PLUS survey images using deeper images of the same objects from Legacy survey as a baseline for training. Preliminary results were qualitatively evaluated and show good concordance with legacy survey images.
